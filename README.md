config
======

CLI tool to fetch secret variables from AWS at service runtime.

## Usage

Download the latest binary from the releases page and run like so,

```
$ ./config <SSM parameter name>
```

**This will print the decrypted value to stdout.** Be aware of this when using it at service runtime,
and always opt for using this in conjunction with an environment variable, set at runtime.

```
ENV_VAR=$(./config <SSM parameter name>)
```

### Authorization and Setup

When including this tool in a service, the service must have the following IAM statements
included in its role policy.

```
...
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "ssm:GetParameters",
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:parameter/<SSM parameter name>"
        ( add other parameters as necessary )
    ]
},
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:*:*:key/<SSM key id>"
}
...
```

where `<SSM key id>` is the UUID of the encryption key you chose when pushing the value to SSM.

Be sure to assign your IAM task roles to the task definition like so,

```
"ExecutionRoleArn": { "Fn::GetAtt": [ "ECSTaskRole", "Arn" ] },
"TaskRoleArn": { "Fn::GetAtt": [ "ECSTaskRole", "Arn" ] },
```

Also, set the default region environment variable in the service's task defintion to match the
region where the SSM value exists. This is used by the AWS SDK inside this utility.

```
"ContainerDefinitions": [{
    ...
    "Environment": [
        { "Name": "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION", "Value": { "Ref": "AWS::Region" } },
        ...
    ],
    ...
```
